This Arduino-based IoT system uses an ESP32 to connect seamlessly to a Wi-Fi network and publish sensor data via MQTT.
It's designed for real-time monitoring of analog and digital sensors, making it ideal for robotics, smart environments, and remote diagnostics.
The code features continuous 12-bit analog readings, intelligent Wi-Fi reconnection logic, and modular components for maintainability.
Digital inputs are set up with internal pull-ups, making them resilient and noise-tolerant. 
Whether you're collecting environmental data, tracking motion, or logging system diagnostics, this project provides a robust foundation.
